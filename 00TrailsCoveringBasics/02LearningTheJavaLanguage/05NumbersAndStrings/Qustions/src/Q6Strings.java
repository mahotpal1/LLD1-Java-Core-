/*
    An anagram is a word or a phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase; for example,
    "parliament" is an anagram of "partial men," and "software" is an anagram of "swear oft." Write a program that figures out whether one string is an anagram of another string. The program should ignore white space and punctuation.
